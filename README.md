# Overview

This is a classic "Hello World" application. The goal here is to demonstrate how git works with github and VS Code. I am using github as version control for all of my projects. The nice thing about VS Code is that they have both GUI for git and command line. You can use one that is fits your needs the best. I use it combined.
